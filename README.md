heyy all! I was studying Data-Time and I made three projects in it. It was fun and Explorative to study. I had new perspectives and dimension on how I could develop these projects further.
my first project is "Birthday Calculator" which allowsyou to calculate your age - including months and dates exactly. 
Second project was about "Count Down" which allows the user to get a count down of perticular event like birthdays, exams etc.,(well, this project got me thinking on how i could furthur develop in frontend and give it a life as a app) 
Third project was Quite interesting as it allowed me to give a pop-up message reminder in my laptop. which was quite fun as I have always thought of how these "Pop-ups" work. kindly take a look at them and how they run. 
Always welcome feedbacks and comments. Thankyou for checking out!
